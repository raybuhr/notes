# Radical Candor

1. Care and develop trust in relationships. People don't accept feedback if they don't believe it's coming from a place of honesty and good intentions. People automatically reject feedback coming from a place of superority. 
2. Operationalizing feedback. Start gentle, but move to more direct until understood. Don't make it personal. There's only two aspects to good guidance: care deeply and challenge directly. To care personally and challenge directly is _radical candor_. To challenge directly, but fail to care personally it's _obnoxious aggression_. To care personally, but fail to challenge directly is _ruinous empathy_. To neither care personally or challenge directly is _manipulative insincerity_. You don't have to know a person a long time or build a lot of trust to offer radical candor. You have to be "not mean, but clear". 
  - start with praise before moving to criticism
  - investigate praise as thoroughly as criticism to ensure sincerity
  - ask for criticism and listen and reward the candor
  - think about what quadrant you're likely to be perceived as coming from before you issue praise or criticism
3. Your job as a boss is not to provide purpose to your teammates, but to get to know what they find value and propose from. People tend to alternate between growth and stability phases in life. You need people in both phases to have a great team. Try and help people find the right job for them. Don't force responsibility, but give freely when asked for (or needed). Huge part of role of boss is setting the quality bar. It does no one a favor to forever accept mediocrity.
4. Need to make it safe for ideas to emerge and build up before they are criticised and killed, otherwise we prevent some good ideas from taking root. It's on the person delivering am idea to make it clear, not the listener. It's on the listener to give the presenter time and ability to share their idea with an open mind. Rock tumbler analogy -- debate takes time and emotional energy, but transforms rough ideas into smooth gems. Leadership requires allowing and encouraging debate instead of decisions, but not letting it go too long. It's valuable to make people present both sides of the debate so they listen more carefully and think more critically. Providing pauses/breaks can give time for thought and new energy to a debate. A "decide by date" might be necessary though in order not to drag out indefinitely. We need to learn to be more persuasive, and to be better at explaining why along with the facts.
5. Listen and provide opportunities to listen and receive feedback.
6. Don't say you're wrong. Instead say that's wrong. Keep arguments about issue instead of personal. Never say "don't take it personally" is worthless. Likewise "don't be sad/mad/etc" since it inevitably only focuses those emotions. Proceed with caution if you are not in position of authority and/or unable to have that kind of relationship with your boss. Start by asking for guidance before giving it out. When you get feedback, don't debate the criticism. Also don't accept feint praise. If your boss allows feedback, start with something small. Listen, challenge, commit -- listen to ideas, challenge when you disagree, commit when it's time to decide. 
7. Partnership management as opposed to micro management or absentee management
8. One on ones -- let employee set agenda, your job is to answer questions, get to know better, build trust, plan for future. Not for providing feedback, criticism, etc. Think of these as coffee breaks more than meetings. Your job is to hold accountable if no agenda brought or decide to be ok without one. Some questions that might help:
  -  why?
  - how can I help?
  - what can I do/stop doing to help?
  - what keeps you up at night?
  - what are you working on that you don't want to? Lack of interest or not important? How can we get you to stop working on it?
  - what do you want to work on? Why not? How can we get to work on that?
  - how do you feel about priorities of the team?
  - what are we not doing that you wish we would do?
  - don't solve problem for them, just help them figure it out on their own
  - ask questions for idea generation or to improve communication/clarity of their presentation of their ideas
  - signs of bad one on one
    - status update only
    - no agenda
    - canceling
    - no bad news
    - no criticism
9. Staff meetings (team meetings)
  - how things went previous week
  - share announcements/updates
  - clarifies decisions/debates for coming week
  - should not be place of debate
  - should ideally use key metrics and a dashboard
10. Schedule think time -- 1-2 hours a week that can't be overridden
11. Schedule big debate meetings
  - not about coming to decision
  - forces team to think about ideas
  - fosters a culture of debate
  - lowers tension by providing an outlet for expressing ideas and getting perspectives, as well as making sure everyone feels heard
  - everyone should be able to attend
  - agenda needs to be present, decider/moderator needs to be named ahead of meeting
  - goal is to come up with best answer, not win debate (getting it right vs being right)
  - require people to switch sides to build debate muscle and be forced to think through both sides
